# Lunar-Lander
Implement reinforcement learning to train lunar lander to land on the moon safely. Assignment from Machine Learning Specialization by DeepLearning.AI and Standford

* <i>Write an unsupervised learning algorithm to **Land the Lunar Lander** Using Deep Q-Learning</i>

    - The Rover was trained to land correctly on the surface, correctly between the flags as indicators after many unsuccessful attempts in learning how to do it.
    - The final landing after training the agent using appropriate parameters :
